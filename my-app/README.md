B.1 Install Instructions

1. You must have Node.js v20.11.0 or above. (you could try with an older version of Node
   but this hasn’t been tested)
2. After opening the project directory, run the following command in the terminal: npm
   install
3. Then to host the web app on your local server: npm run dev
4. To run tests: npm run test
   B.2 App Instructions
   • Accessing the Tool: Navigate to the tool’s website using your preferred web browser.
   • Home Page Overview: Upon arrival at the home page, you will find options to create a
   new argumentation graph and learn about different labelling algorithms.
   • Choose Input Method: Select either the relational or logical structure option to input
   your graph data. For relational input, enter pairs of arguments representing directed
   edges (e.g., (A,B) for an attack from A to B). For logical input, specify facts and rules in
   the provided fields.
   • Submit: Once you have entered your data, click the ’Submit’ or ’Generate’ button to
   create your graph.
   • Interacting with the Graph: The generated graph will be displayed on the ’Graph’ page.
   You can interact with the graph by clicking and dragging nodes or zooming in and out
   for better visibility.
   • Select Algorithm: Choose from the Grounded, Admissible, or Preferred labelling algo-
   rithm to analyse your graph.
   • Exploring Labelling Results: For the Preferred algorithm, you may see multiple possi-
   ble labellings. Use the provided controls to scroll through these labellings and explore
   different argument subsets.
   • Learning about Algorithms: Click the ’Info’ button next to each algorithm’s name to
   open a modal with a detailed description of how it works.
   • Navigating the Application: Use the persistent ’Home’ button at the top left to return to
   the home page at any point.
   • To create a new graph or change algorithms, navigate using the menu or back to the home
   page.
   • Saving Your Work: Currently, you may take a screenshot or note the URL where your
   generated graph is displayed to save your work. Future updates may include a feature to
   save your graphs directly within the application.
   •
   By following these instructions, you should be able to effectively use the Abstract Argumenta-
   tion Framework Tool to create, label, and analyse argumentation graphs.
   B.3 Warnings
   • Any user input that doesn’t adhere to the example structure shown on the web page, may
   give unexpected results.
